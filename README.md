# NLP_Coursework Repository

This repository contains solutions to exercises from a Natural Language Processing coursework.

### Exercise 1: Language Modeling and Spelling Correction
Focuses on fundamental concepts in language modeling and spelling correction.

- Theoretical Questions: Derivation of probability sum in bigram models, analysis of language models for spelling correction.
- Practical Implementation: Includes unigram and bigram language models for predicting word sequences and computing perplexity.

### Exercise 2: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Part-of-Speech Tagging
Covers Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for sequence prediction and part-of-speech tagging.

- Implemented Viterbi algorithm for sequence prediction.
- Developed a four-gram HMM tagger using NLTK and the Brown corpus.

### Exercise 3: Text Classification with Machine Learning
Focuses on classifying text documents into predefined categories using machine learning techniques.

- Data Preparation: Preprocessed text data for machine learning models.
- Feature Extraction: Extracted features like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF vectors, and word embeddings.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Trained models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Comparison of Approaches: Compared effectiveness of different techniques and algorithms.
- Deployment Considerations: Discussed scalability, model interpretation, and performance monitoring.
- Example Applications: Included sentiment analysis, topic classification, and spam email detection.

### Exercise 4: Text Classification with Transformer Models
Explores Transformer models for text classification using a subset of the 20newsgroups dataset.

- Log-linear Classifier: Implemented Logistic Regression with TFIDF vectors.
- Fine-tuning a Transformer Model: Used distilroberta-base for sequence classification with specific hyperparameters.
- Zero-Shot Classification: Used cross-encoder/nli-MiniLM2-L6-H768 model for zero-shot classification.
- Model Comparison: Compared model accuracy and sensitivity to training set size.
